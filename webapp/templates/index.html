<h3><strong>About</strong></h3>

The purpose of this study is to find out the quality of an automatic music accompaniemnt system, i.e. how well the automatic generated accompaniment fits a given melody. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the model developed in our project "Automatic Music Accompaniment".

<br><br>
The study will take you about <strong>10 minutes</strong>. In the study, <strong>you will be asked to</strong>
<br>
- listen to several pieces of music audios and evaluate the quality of their accompaniments;
<br>
- give some comments on the automatic generated music, and our study;
<br>
- verify some weakness in the automatic accompaniment system;
<br>
- judge whether the automatic accompaniemnt system can help with musicians/non-musicians in their music creation.

<br><br>
<strong>The user study page is tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari and Internet Explorer (lastest versions), If you have problem in playing  audios, try chrome or another browser first.</strong>
