        Long-Short-Time-Memory networks (LSTMs) provide a good model structure for
        sequence processing tasks. Recent years, experiments based on deep neural networks
        for music generation such as Magenta and BachBot showed interesting results. This
        report explains the design and implementation of a deep neural network for automatic
        music accompaniment generation. The model uses an LSTM network and can generate
        reasonable music accompaniments according to melodies in classical style. In this
        project, a method of encoding music into arrays of data representations is introduced,
        and a model is developed to compose accompaniments sequentially. An evaluation of
        the model is performed with humans in a user study, in which the qualities of music
        pieces generated with different models (the developed model and a simple LSTM
        model) are compared. In general, the developed model is able to generate
        accompaniments that follow the keys and rhythms of the melodies, although making
        mistakes occasionally and cannot predict an appreciate sequence ending. The source
        code for this project is at
